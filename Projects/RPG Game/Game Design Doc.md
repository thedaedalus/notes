# RPG Game (Working Title)

This is for an RPG game that I want to make. I need to work out a name for the game. But I am wanting to use this as a learning experience to further my programming skills. 

+ Need to find resources to use. 
+ Work out the setting
+ I think this will be a 2D pixel art game as it seems to be the easiest to implement at this stage. 
+ work out movement style e.g. point and click to move or keyboard movement. 
	+ if point and click some sort of path finding will need to be implemented.
